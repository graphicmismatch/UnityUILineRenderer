# UILineRenderer
The built-in Linerenderer doesnt work if the canvas is set to Overlay render mode.
This script adds this functionality in the form of an alternative linerenderer.
## How to use
1. Create a Canvas and set the Render Mode to "Screen Space - Overlay"
2. Add the UILineRenderer script to any object inside the canvas that has a Canvas Renderer and Rect Transform
3. Add points either via code on Runtime, in Editor by changing the Point list, or using the "add points in Scene View" action
